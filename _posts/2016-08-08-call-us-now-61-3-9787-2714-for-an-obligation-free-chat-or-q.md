**FOR AN OBLIGATION FREE CHAT OR QUOTE.**

QMIS Pty Limited was established in 1997 as management consulting company to provide professional services at a project and / or organisational level specialising in the construction and engineering sectors.

The main objectives then was to assist organisations in improving their work practices, achieve efficiencies and, as required, attain third-party accreditation and certification of their Quality (ISO9001), Safety (AS/NZS4801 & OHSAS18001) & Environmental (ISO14001) management systems.

While we continue to provide management systems development advice and quality, safety and environmental auditing services. We have continued to grow and expand our services and we now are actively engaged in providing advice and assistance on a wide range of issues including change management, community consultation, facilitation, training and corporate social responsibility including triple bottom line reporting.
