# Documented Information

There is no longer a requirement to maintain a systems manual or documented procedures..!

BUT

The management system has to include the "Documented Information" needed for the effective functioning of the system

The purpose of this change is to take account of technological and societal changes. Information is no longer created, organised, managed, maintained, disseminated and accessed as it was 20 years ago when paper was the primary medium.

This change also allows for greater flexibility in companies' organization. It is now possible to comply with the standard without managerial agility being affected, as long as the fundamental principles are respected.
