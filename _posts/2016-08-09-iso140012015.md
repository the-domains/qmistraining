# ISO14001:2015

The new ISO 14001 2015 standard asks you to establish an emergency preparedness and response procedure in section 8.2, and that's the only one.

Instead of asking you to write procedures, the new standard expects you to maintain and control a wide range of documents (i.e., documented information). Since the new standard doesn't tell you what to call these documents, you can call them procedures if you like. And, of course, you still need to have documents except that now they're called "documented information". So, while on the surface this looks like a radical change, it probably isn't.
